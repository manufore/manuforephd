Eucalyptus nitens is the main plantation eucalypt in Tasmania with around 208,000 hectares, where it is grown for pulp, timber and other engineered wood products. In Tasmania, over the period 2015-19, it has been estimated that around 4% of hardwood log volume will come from plantations managed under solid-wood silvicultural regimes (i.e. thinned and pruned) and this is predicted to increase due to the need to replace the diminishing supply of logs from native forest resources. Thus there is need to produce higher value solid-wood products from plantations. The genetic improvement of this E. nitens plantation resource has traditionally focused on selection traits, which are related to breeding traits (e.g. harvest age volume, basic density and pulp yield) which affect the economics of producing pulp. However, with increasing interest in using and improving plantations for veneer and timber production other traits apart from growth and wood density are of potential importance. Such traits include tree form and wood properties such as checking and wood stiffness. However, research is required on the environmental effects on and genetic control of these selection traits. This project will exploit historic data sets and new measurements in field trials established across the E. nitens plantation estate in Tasmania to study the influence of genetics and environment on these solid-wood selection traits.
